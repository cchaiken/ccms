  - As a singer/songwriter looking to hone my gifts and stretch myself both vocally
    and on the piano - Caylia has been a gift. She cares tremendously and is truthful
    in her coaching. She is dedicated to helping me discover my own voice, use my
    words and voice to convey the message I want to put into the world and express
    it in a way this is truly me

## My Background & Experience

As a **Musician and Performer** I trained in voice and piano at the **San Francisco Conservatory of Music** and was awarded Bachelor of Fine Arts for Music and Musical Theater from **San Francisco State University**.

By age 14 I wrote my first Musical (*I know, right?*) and have been creating ever since. I’ve written, produced, composed and performed 2 one woman shows ([The Date Whisperer](https://chaikenmusic.bandcamp.com/album/caylia-chaiken-the-date-whisperer) & [Bare Naked](https://chaikenmusic.bandcamp.com/album/caylia-chaiken-bare-naked)) to sold out audiences in Marin, Sonoma and San Francisco and have been a Producer, Performer and Accompanist for many Cabaret Acts,  School Musicals, Theater Companies and Talent Shows.

I've been fortunate to have worked with many wonderful North Bay musical theater programs including the Marin Youth Musical Theater Program at the [Throckmorton Theater](http://throckmortontheatre.org/) (founding Musical Director), Vector Theater (Musical Director) and TheaterNow Productions (Musical Director and performer).

As an **Educator** I hold a Masters of Education from Marin County's own Dominican University and am fully credentialed to teach music in the State of California. I am also accredited to teach the [Simply Music™](https://simplymusic.com) method of Piano Education.

Many schools and studios have hosted my classes and workshops. I was delighted to be the Choral Director and Elementary Music Teacher in the Ross Valley School District where I worked with hundreds of students from Wade Thomas, White Hill Middle School, Manor Elementary and Brookside schools. I’ve also taught General Music (K-5) at several schools in the Mill Valley and San Rafael districts.

## Am I a practicing musician?

**YES!**

As a professional pianist, singer, composer and songwriter I have performed across the USA. I was honored to perform the [National Anthem](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqdYqJS9inU) in front of 47,000 people at the SF Giants Stadium. I received a standing ovation on the day (well... *they were already standing*) and most importantly, **we won the game**. I like to think that I had something to do with it!

You can listen to a selection of my work in the Store, [Bandcamp](http://chaikenmusic.bandcamp.com/) and on my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCa56OJaXhqQN9ei7iiYszEg). If you’d like to see me perform be sure to [follow me on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/cayliachaikenmusicstudio/) for the latest event news.
