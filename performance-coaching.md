## Crowd out the fear!

Have you ever felt terrified by the notion of being in front of a crowd of people?  That fear and self consciousness is often the only thing stopping you from achieving your long held dreams in life. 

It could be blocking you from nailing a job interview or musical audition. Perhaps it’s holding you back from securing a new client, or presenting results to stakeholders in a compelling and positive way. The [applications](#) are endless.

It doesn’t matter who you are or what you do….

**Performance Coaching benefits everybody**

Your life is filled with a thousand forms of “performance” so why restrict your success and potential just because of a few challenges?

There’s no reason why you can’t be the next Steve Jobs or Lady Gaga in your field and all it takes is a few lessons to get you on your way. 

## Find your Flow

There is a way to harness creative flow in all that you do and bring your audience into the magic of your work.

We all have different triggers and self imposed limitations - that’s where my personalized coaching can be the catalyst to your success. 

It won’t take long to notice a difference. I will give you tangible results from your very first lesson.

## Free Performance Coaching Tip

Visualize your performance like an Olympic athlete would a race:

- Create an image of the space you will perform in
- See yourself on stage in front of an excited audience

- Travel through a compelling rendition of your presentation and imagine your audience alongside you, supporting you, every step of the way.  

And practice, practice, practice - it’s great at generating confidence!
