### Why Music?

Hans Christian Andersen could not have said it better when he penned the famous saying - *“Where words fail...music speaks”*

Music is healing and transformative. It has the power to dissolve boundaries and bring people together from every corner of the world.

**Supercharge Your Brain**

Learning and playing music is fantastic for neurological development. It will fundamentally alter your nervous system for the better, improve your fine motor skills, memory and cognition.
