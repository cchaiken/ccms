    - I came to Caylia after years of vocal training. She is  a dream. She helped
      me to retrain my voice so that I sang in an organic way, allowing my body to
      simply click into place. I am thrilled to be learning from her.

    - I am 9 years old and I take voice lessons from Caylia.
    - She is a wonderful teacher because she improves how you sing and then she improves
      the things that improve what you've improved on. For example she makes me use
      my belly when I sing by having me stand on one foot.

    - Caylia teaches with humor, perfection and persistence.
    - She doesn’t seem to force her style on her students but rather explores the
      natural potential and refines and develops it. Caylia’s passion for the music
      and her commitment to her students always shines through.

      music theory, and seasonal holiday tunes.
    - She expertly engages my daughters in specific, age-appropriate programs according
      to their interest and ability.
    - She tunes in to the comments my children make to enhance their understanding
      and appreciation of music.

    - Caylia is a terrific teacher. Caylia is very patient and intuitive and has the
      ability to adjust her teaching style to the different kid’s needs and personalities.

    - Caylia has opened my kids up to their own sense of improvisation and confidence.
    - Simply music is helping them to trust their ears and learning to hear music
      differently and therefore play music differently.
    - What’s cool about Caylia is that she takes a song that my kids love and shows
      them, like in 5 minutes, how to play the song. She knows that my kids know the
      songs and chords and in no time at all, they are playing songs that they love.
    - It’s been a fantastic year. My kids have grown as artist, as people with Caylia
      and express themselves and comfortable and that is all we can ask.

    - Marin Idol was an extremely fun and interactive way to improve my singing skills.
      It had all the fun of being at a summer  camp with the added bonus of learning
      amazing vocal techniques that I still use to this day. I highly recommend Marin
      Idol for singers of all ages

      have a fun time and fun have a fun camp for the summer and also improve their
      singing.

    - I was nice for me as a parent to know that during the summer, she had this wonderful
      thing to do with her best friend. And with Caylia, in a beautiful setting she
      was also able to polish up some of her skills that she’s learning in her voice
      lessons.
    - One of the things I love about her singing, is that she feels more confident
      using her voice. I find that she is able to express herself better and the singing
      lessons have a lot to do with it.
    - Love Caylia, love Marin Idol, love the lessons and I highly recommend that you
      get your kids started!

      and unwind. I think that my daughter will use that skill, talent and love for
      the rest of her life.

    - I realized just how special Caylia is after my daughter took an entire year
      of lessons and we were at her annual recital. It was full of supporting families
      and over 30 kids.  It was a while before it suddenly dawned on me that Caylia
      had single handedly taught every one of these kids all I was hearing!  She truly
      is an amazing gift to our community and my children.
