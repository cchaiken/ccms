title: Music is a catalyst that brings our emotions, feelings and sense of creativity to the forefront of our lives!

My first day at the San Francisco Conservatory of Music was as intimidating as it was exciting.  The Conservatory's Outreach Program, a program that sends musicians out to perform at local Convalescent Homes, hospitals and other service facilities, heard about my reputation as a Cabaret Singer, so they sent me out to perform classics from popular American music standards; show tunes and popular songs.
 
My first experience at one of the Convalescent Homes was naturally frightening for a young singer/pianist. I was overcome by the lack of physical reaction and animation of the residents. However, I was a skilled performer and I was there to entertain.       
 
I played many popular musical pieces and received the obligatory applause, slight and calm. In the middle of my program, I looked out to see if my music had changed any of the expressions from the elderly audience's faces. That was when I was struck by the presence of one woman. She appeared to be comatose; her face had no expression and her body sat limp in her wheelchair. I was alarmed by her presence, being young and vivacious and quickly realized the distinct differences between our ages and our physicality.

Realizing that I had twenty more minutes to perform and the show was not creating the "stir" that I had expected, I just sat at the piano, resigned, and sang from my heart. I sang "As Time Goes By." This was the theme song from the 1942 movie, Casablanca, written by Herman Hupfeld. It is a classic and very well known. However, the refrain at the beginning is not as well known as the rest of the song and is a little teaser before you sing the rest of the song which leads to the "AH-HA, I know this song" reaction.
 
I remember looking over at the woman whose body remained motionless and yet, I saw her big toe moving at the beat of the song. In that moment, she told me that she had her "ah-ha moment" and knew the song.
 
No applause has ever sounded as appreciative in my ears as that day where in silence I realized that my music was having a positive effect on my audience. This strengthened my belief that music encompasses the soul and the emotions.
