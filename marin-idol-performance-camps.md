  - Marin Idol was an extremely fun and interactive way to improve my singing skills.
    It had all the fun of being at a summer camp with the added bonus of learning
    amazing vocal techniques that I still use to this day. I highly recommend Marin
    Idol for singers of all ages.

Set among the beautiful hills of Mill Valley, my studio comes alive with the sounds of song and laughter. You’ll make new friends and form creative partnerships in a highly collaborative atmosphere.

- Learn to shine onstage like a Pop Star!
- Find your own true voice to stand apart from the pack
- Discover how to sing, harmonize, dance and interact with fellow performers

- Express your fashion style with unique clothing, hair and makeup

**Marin Idol will give you skills for life.**

You’ll find that book reports, meetings, interviews and even first dates will never be the same!

You will become a better communicator and develop the confidence to present yourself professionally; connecting to audiences of all kinds. You’ll also become more adept at representing and promoting your best interests, but most importantly you will come out knowing how to have fun expressing yourself!
