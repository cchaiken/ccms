  - Marin Idol was an extremely fun and interactive way to improve my singing skills.
    It had all the fun of being at a summer camp with the added bonus of learning
    amazing vocal techniques that I still use to this day. I highly recommend Marin
    Idol for singers of all ages.

**Marin Idol will give you skills for life.**

You’ll find that book reports, meetings, interviews and even first dates will never be the same!

You will become a better communicator and develop the confidence to present yourself professionally; connecting to audiences of all kinds.
