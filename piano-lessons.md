## What is Simply Music?

[Simply Music&trade;](https://simplymusic.com/) is a multi-sensory program that offers a transformative piano education. It approaches learning in a totally new way and will have you playing amazing music of all genres from your very first lesson.

### How is it different?

Traditional piano lessons focus on learning to read music in order to play it. This “read first, play later” approach is slow. Many students find it frustrating and lose enthusiasm before they get to enjoy playing music.

**Simply Music&trade; approaches music education like “learning to talk”. We all talked long before we learned how to read and spell.**

Simply Music&trade; *delays* the reading part and instead focuses on how to *play* music from a wide range of styles. Once you know how to “talk music” through a wide repertoire of songs we’ll learn how to read music, when it’s easy and intuitive.

You’ll quickly develop the ability to play chords and modern accompaniments in every musical key. And most importantly, you’ll find yourself having fun from your first note!

### Can I learn the songs I want to play?

***Absolutely!***

**Simply Music&trade; works with any kind of music.** It’s a kinesthetic learning method which means that you learn the songs through through a multi-sensory learning process. This approach reveals the patterns behind the song so you can recognize and play their melodies with ease.

## Free Piano Tip!

Here is a game to help you achieve the [rounded hand position](#):

1. Pretend your hand is a crab and “walk” it on a table.
2. Have a friend attempt to “walk” across to your side of the table with their “crab hand”.
3. Have your crab guard it's side of the table from your friends crab.

The more you play, the better your rounded piano hand position will become. It's fun!
